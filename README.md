Basic Machine Learning Algorithms and Explanations


My journey with machine learning, I have taken some inspiration from DanB from kaggle, I followed his intital getting  started tutorails and designed. You can consider the set of tutorials and code as a brief intro in various models and algorithms which you can implement using Python.

So basic knowledge of python is required to understand the code, in addition to that you might need to know basic mathematics and linear algebra to understand the models used.
